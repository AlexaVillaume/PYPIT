The following is a list of items that are currently in development

** All items in the code with msgs.work("message") need to be implemented

* Write sorted files to fits table (let the user pick which method)
* Store master calibrations for each master frame (to save recalculating the solutions -- including slit trace, tilts, and wavelength)
* Flexure correction (TH)
* Extraction (RJC)
* Quick reduction methods (for use in real time at the telescope)
* In function pypit.PYPIT, change argflag to allow for command line quick reduction (near line 110)
* In function pypit.PYPIT, check for successful reduction and print reduction status (near line 125)
* In function pypArmlsd.SetupScience, rethink how Science data will be saved (i.e. with their science name appended?)
* Force matplotlib RC params of plots to be the default throughout (i.e. don't allow user-specified matplotlib rcparams)
* Have reduction features be read from instrument settings file
* Avoid re-making Bias, Arc, etc. frames as an option
* Organize lamp line lists better (1 file!!)
* Add code to confirm rejected arc lines are in NIST lists (e.g. when the NIST wavelengths change)
* barycentric velocity correction
* Code to parse settings file into a Web Page, especially image type conditions
* Flat indexing in "setup", e.g. arspecobj.init_exp
* What should we do about multiple standard stars?
* Allow both bias and overscan to be used
* How much effort for backwards-compatability (e.g. old detectors)?  RJC -> 1 settings file per detector (e.g. detector upgrade -> new settings file)?
* If an error is encountered and the code terminates, be sure to first execute slf._qa.close() on all ScienceExposure classes (i.e. write the QA so the user can diagnose possible problems)
* Generate tests for adding new instrument
